Integrating a custom kernel module (like your ADS1115 driver) into the Linux kernel source allows it to be built as part of the kernel tree. Follow these steps to integrate your custom kernel module into the kernel source tree:

---

### **1. Organize Your Driver**
Place your `ads1115.c` file in the appropriate kernel subsystem directory, based on its functionality. For example:
- Since the ADS1115 is an I2C-based ADC driver, place it under:
  ```
  drivers/iio/adc/
  ```

---

### **2. Modify the Makefile**
Edit the `Makefile` in the target directory (`drivers/iio/adc/`) to include your module.

1. Open the file:
   ```bash
   nano drivers/iio/adc/Makefile
   ```

2. Add an entry for your driver:
   ```makefile
   obj-$(CONFIG_ADS1115) += ads1115.o
   ```

---

### **3. Update the Kconfig File**
Modify the `Kconfig` file in the target directory to provide a configuration option for your driver.

1. Open the file:
   ```bash
   nano drivers/iio/adc/Kconfig
   ```

2. Add a new entry:
   ```text
   config ADS1115
       tristate "TI ADS1115 ADC driver"
       depends on I2C
       help
         Say Y here if you want to enable support for the ADS1115
         analog-to-digital converter.

         To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
         will be called ads1115.
   ```

---

### **4. Enable Your Driver in the Kernel Configuration**
1. Run the kernel configuration tool:
   ```bash
   make menuconfig
   ```
   - Navigate to `Device Drivers -> Industrial I/O support -> Analog to digital converters`.
   - Locate your driver (e.g., `TI ADS1115 ADC driver`) and enable it (`Y` to build-in or `M` to build as a module).

2. Save and exit.

---

### **5. Rebuild the Kernel**
1. Clean and build the kernel with your new module:
   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc) && make modules_install && make install
   ```

2. If you only want to build the module after configuration, use:
   ```bash
   make M=drivers/iio/adc/
   ```

---

### **6. Install and Test Your Kernel**
1. Reboot into the newly built kernel:
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

2. Test your module:
   - If built as a module, load it:
     ```bash
     modprobe ads1115
     ```

   - Check `dmesg` for logs:
     ```bash
     dmesg | grep ADS1115
     ```

---

### **7. Submit Your Code for Upstreaming (Optional)**
If your driver is generic and useful for the Linux kernel community, consider submitting it for upstream inclusion:
1. **Prepare Your Patch**:
   Use `git` to create a patch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git format-patch HEAD~N
   ```
   Replace `N` with the number of commits made for your driver.

2. **Submit the Patch**:
   Send the patch to the appropriate subsystem maintainers and mailing lists using:
   ```bash
   git send-email --to=maintainer@example.com --cc=linux-iio@vger.kernel.org ...
   ```

3. Follow the Linux kernel contribution guidelines in [`SubmittingPatches`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html).

---

### **Tips**
- Use `checkpatch.pl` to verify coding style compliance:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict ads1115.c
  ```

- Use `make M=drivers/iio/adc/ C=1 CHECK=1` to perform static analysis.

By following these steps, your custom driver will be fully integrated into the kernel source tree and can be built and managed like any other kernel module.
