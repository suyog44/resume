To debug your issue in patch-scs.c, you can use pr_info to trace the kernel's execution flow and variable states. Here is a practical guide on how to do this.

Here are the key steps and some strategic locations to place your debug statements:

🛠️ How to Add pr_info for Debugging

Using pr_info is straightforward. You can add it to trace execution and inspect variables.

Basic Syntax:

```c
pr_info("Message: %s\n", argument); // For a simple string
pr_info("Reached function %s at line %d\n", __func__, __LINE__); // For function name and line number
pr_info("Variable value: %d\n", my_var); // For an integer variable
```

Adding Context Automatically:
To automatically prefix allpr_info messages in your file with the module and function name, define pr_fmt at the very top of patch-scs.c (before any #include directives).

```c
#define pr_fmt(fmt) KBUILD_MODNAME ": %s: " fmt, __func__
```

After this definition, a simple pr_info("hello\n"); will output something like patch_scs: scs_patch_loc: hello.

🔍 Strategic Placement in patch-scs.c

Based on your code, placing pr_info in these key functions and branches can help you pinpoint the problem.

Location Example Code Debugging Purpose
Top of scs_patch pr_info("eh_frame @%p, size: %d\n", eh_frame, size); Log input parameters to verify data is valid.
CIE Processing Block pr_info("Processing CIE, aug_string: %s\n", frame->augmentation_string); Check CIE header parsing and augmentation string.
FDE Processing Call pr_info("Processing FDE, initial_loc: 0x%llx\n", (u64)offset_to_ptr(&frame->initial_loc)); Confirm FDE frame handling and location calculation.
Inside scs_handle_fde_frame loop pr_info("Opcode: 0x%x, Location: 0x%llx, Size left: %d\n", opcode[-1], loc, size); Trace DWARF opcode interpretation and location tracking.
Before scs_patch_loc call pr_info("About to patch instruction at 0x%llx\n", loc - 4); Critical: logs the address before patching.
Inside scs_patch_loc pr_info("Patching at 0x%llx: insn 0x%x\n", loc, insn); Confirm the specific instruction being replaced.

A particularly useful check in your scs_handle_fde_frame function is to log the flow around the DW_CFA_negate_ra_state opcode:

```c
case DW_CFA_negate_ra_state:
    pr_info("Found DW_CFA_negate_ra_state at virtual loc: 0x%llx\n", loc);
    pr_info("-> Will patch physical address 0x%llx (loc-4)\n", loc - 4);
    if (!dry_run)
        scs_patch_loc(loc - 4);
    break;
```

📋 Viewing the Debug Output and Final Tips

Once you've added your pr_info statements, recompile and reinstall the kernel module. View the output using the dmesg command. For a continuous log, use dmesg -w or tail -f /var/log/kern.log.

Keep these points in mind for an effective debugging process:

· Leverage Dry-Run: Your function has a dry_run parameter. The first pass validates the FDE, and the second does the patching. Add logs in both passes to see if the behavior differs.
· Check for Crashes Early: If the system crashes before you can see dmesg output, redirect kernel messages to a serial console, which can save logs to a file on your host machine.
· Focus on the Suspect: Your theory that DWARF data might be bad is a strong lead. Pay close attention to the addresses being calculated and the specific instructions found at those addresses before patching.
